# sudoku

Currently, this is a static page sudoku puzzle web app. There is one sudoku puzzle that will load (with a couple of alternate options commented out in the code).
This contains the full user interface to manually solve the sudoku puzzle, as well as a javascript method to solve automatically ("solveTable()").

Eventually, I would like to add a back-end algorithm to generate new sudoku puzzles, select puzzle difficulty, and track solve times on various difficulty levels and total puzzles solved.
